#Solrstrap

Solrstrap is a Query-Result interface for Solr. Solrstrap is intended to be a starting point for those building webapplications for Solr.

##What does Solrstrap do?
Solrstrap takes search queries and displays search results.

##Why is Solrstrap cool?
Solrstrap is cool because it does everything in Javascript, CSS and HTML on the client side. There is no clunky serverside stuff happening. JSON is shot back from the server and interpeted by the web browser.

Solrstrap therefore requires much less server power and bandwidth than normal Solr clients.

This _probably_ makes solrstrap the fastest available rendering engine for Solr.

##How do I make it work?
Simply clone this project and click on /solrstrap.html. Thats it.

##What is Solrstrap made of?
Solr strap is lovingly crafted from [Bootstrap][http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/] and [Handlebars][http://handlebarsjs.com].
